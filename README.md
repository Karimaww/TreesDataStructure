# Tree

Implementing in C a hierarchical data structure that represents relationships between various nodes. In this project, I explore the utilization of different tree types within the realm of data structures to efficiently store a French dictionary.

The following tree structures have been employed:

* Binary Tree: A fundamental tree structure where each node can have at most two child nodes, facilitating quick and straightforward dictionary storage.
* Binary Search Tree (BST): A specialized binary tree that maintains the dictionary entries in a sorted order. This enables efficient searching and retrieval operations, making it a valuable choice for dictionaries.
* Lexicographic Tree: This tree structure excels at handling language-related data like dictionaries. It organizes words or phrases alphabetically, which simplifies word lookup and enables various language-related operations.
